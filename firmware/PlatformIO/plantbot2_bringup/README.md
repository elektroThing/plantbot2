## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### No I2C Devices Found
```
Total devices found: 0
âœ— AHT20 sensor not found at address 0x38
```
**Solutions**:
- Check I2C wiring (GPIO14/15)
- Verify sensor power (GPIO3 should be HIGH)
- Inspect solder joints on AHT20

#### Low Battery Voltage
```
âš  Low battery voltage detected (<3.2V)
```
**Solutions**:
- Connect USB-C power source
- Check battery connection
- Verify charging circuit operation

#### AHT20 Communication Failure
```
âœ— AHT20 initialization failed
  - Check wiring and power supply
```
**Solutions**:
- Verify I2C pull-up resistors (10kÎ©)
- Check sensor power switching (GPIO3)
- Test with multimeter on SDA/SCL lines

#### Moisture Sensor Not Responding
```
âœ— Sensor may not be connected properly
  - Check connections to J2
  - Verify 555 timer circuit
```
**Solutions**:
- Check J2 connector and cable
- Verify 555 timer has correct supply voltage
- Consider hardware modification (NE555 â†’ TLC555)

### Hardware Modifications

#### 555 Timer Voltage Issue
The current design uses NE555 which requires >4.5V, but runs on 3.3V:
- **Symptom**: Moisture sensor readings unstable or non-responsive
- **Solution**: Replace NE555 with TLC555 or LMC555 for 3.3V operation
- **Impact**: More reliable moisture sensing

#### Timing Capacitor Adjustment
Current C2 (470pF) may produce frequency too high for soil sensing:
- **Symptom**: Moisture readings not sensitive to soil moisture changes
- **Solution**: Increase C2 to 1-10nF for lower frequency
- **Impact**: Better sensitivity and measurement range

## Interactive Testing

### Manual Verification Steps
1. **Visual LED Test**: Watch status LED cycle through brightness levels
2. **Pump LED Test**: Observe pump status LED (D2) flash during pump test
3. **Light Response**: Use flashlight to verify light sensor response
4. **Moisture Response**: Touch sensor probes with dry/wet materials
5. **Button Test**: Press boot button to skip to test summary

### Serial Monitor Usage
- **Baud Rate**: 115200
- **Real-time Updates**: Tests cycle every 3 seconds
- **Interactive Control**: Press boot button anytime to jump to summary
- **Continuous Operation**: Tests run indefinitely for extended validation
